## About the project
In last year I decided to study the ```Windows API``` and its console methods ðŸ¤”, so this is the first work about it that I did then and have uploaded to GitHub now.<br>
This code is based on my another repository when I show how to simply change symbol color in the Windows console. The link to it is below.

## Something about the code
The in-game text is in Russian (rules and 'interface' at all), but you can intuitively understand its meaning if you have played something like Wordle. <br>You can change it and build the project the way you want because of the ```MIT```. The project was created using Visual Studio and C++.

## The in-game rules
The idea of the game is that the player is randomly given a word from an array of strings (words) and must guess it in five attempts. If the letter is in the right place, then we color it green, if it is in the word, but not in the right place, then make it yellow. <br>A pretty good example of the ```Windows API``` basics.
